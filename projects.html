                            <span class="">This project is a web application designed to streamline order management in food service businesses such as restaurants and cafes. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, ensuring a user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly to various devices. On the backend, Python and Flask were utilized, offering a robust and efficient framework for handling requests, managing sessions, and executing core functionalities. The database layer is powered by SQLAlchemy, a versatile Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies database operations and ensures data integrity.

                            The main goal of this project was to create a lightweight yet functional tool that addresses the specific needs of small to medium-sized food establishments. Key features include streamlined order tracking, intuitive navigation, and a scalable design.

                            Due to the various courses I have completed and continue to attend, I actively practice by working on a variety of small projects and exercises. These include building sample portfolio websites to enhance my frontend skills, developing backend projects focused on business management, and solving programming challenges, primarily in Java recently. These exercises help me strengthen my technical expertise and explore different areas of software development.

                                I am currently developing a website for a barbershop, blending modern aesthetics with a retro vibe. The project involves designing user-friendly navigation and a visually striking gradient background inspired by neon lights and sunsets.
